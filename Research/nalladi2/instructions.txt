Task:

------------

Your job for Sprint 1 is to create a website using Flask as the backend and React as the frontend. 

In the website, include the following:
    Name 
    Major
    Hobbies
    What role you want to take in this project? (frontend, backend, design, etc)

Have fun!

Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/

React: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

Combining the two: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project

Instructions:

Visit this link and install Node.js (get the recommended for most users one): https://nodejs.org/en/

Open up a new terminal window.

cd into wherever you want the project (the entire app we are building this semester) to live

Then clone our repo onto your computer
(You can rename FOLDER_NAME to be whatever you want the folder to be called.)

git clone https://github.com/CS196Illinois/group11-sp21 FOLDER_NAME
cd FOLDER_NAME
cd Research

Now, we're in the research folder of the repo, where you guys will be doing tutorials.
Let's make a React app!
npx create-react-app YOUR_NET_ID
cd YOUR_NET_ID

Now, we'll make the backend Flask server
mkdir api
cd api

For Mac and Linux
python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
pip install flask python-dotenv
touch api.py 

Find the Research folder on your computer, and open it up
Then, paste the code in nalladi2/api.py into your api.py

Edit the file to have your intro!

cd ..

Open up the package.json file you see

Replace the "scripts" key with this:

  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "start-api": "cd api && flask run",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },

At the end of the file, add the following line:

"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"

Also, add a comma to end of the line before what you just entered

We need to install a library to get data from our Flask server

npm install axios

copy the code from nalladi2/App.js into your App.js

npm start
