Project Description: 

We want to build a stock recommendation app that analyses market trends and specific stock history to tell the user to buy or sell, along with when. We decided on a Flask server as our backend, since there are some great finance APIs in Python. For the frontend, we chose React, since it is widely used in industry and easy to learn.
